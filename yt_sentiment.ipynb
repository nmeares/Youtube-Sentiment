      "Function _tokenise(<analysis.sentiment object at 0x12777aa00>, I couldn&#39;t find this video this morning and it looks like it was a bit late but it showed up in my stream this evening. I went to look at the 2010 iMac and they had it in the basement and it was on and there was a folder with a question mark on it and I thought, &quot;this isn&#39;t a good sign.&quot; So I plugged in my keyboard and mouse and rebooted it and it still had the folder with the question mark. So I tried booting it into Recovery Mode and it wouldn&#39;t go. If you&#39;re going to go look at a machine, I recommend bring a bootable flash drive or external SSD so that you can test recovery mode or look around the system. Sometimes you wind up with a system where they formatted the drive and didn&#39;t install an operating system and so you have to bring something with you if you want to find the specs.<br>So it is a Mid-2010 with i7-870, 8 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. Asking was $100 or best offer. I was hoping for an SSD and at least 8 GB of RAM in 2x4GB but it was 4x2GB. I took their offer. I could have bargained them down because they weren&#39;t going to get any other offers as very few people will buy a machine that doesn&#39;t boot. Only crazy people like me carry around an operating system with them.<br>I put it in my trunk and brought it home and had a look at it. It seemed to be fine though the fans were loud. I vacuumed around the vents but the fans were still loud. So I installed a thermal monitor and fan control problem and found that all of the temps were fine, in the 30-55 degree range. But the disk drive fan was running at 2,500 RPM even though the disk drive was at 30 degrees. So I set the fan control for the disk drive to 1,100 RPM (the lowest setting) and that fixed the fan noise. The HDDs have a thermal sensor on them and they can go bad over time and that appears to have happened here. <br>I ordered 16 GB of DDR3 1,600 (it takes 1,333 but 1,600 costs $3 less) and it will arrive in a week though more likely by Monday or Tuesday. That will give me 20 GB of RAM which is enough for office use. I will see if my wife wants the system to replace her 2018 Mac mini base model. If not, I&#39;ll put it on my desk. This means that my 2015 MacBook Pro 15 won&#39;t be needed any longer and I plan to put it up for sale. My son got his 2021 MacBook Pro 14 32/512 from his workplace so I will get my 2014 MacBook Pro 15 back from him when he finishes copying stuff off the 2014. I plan to keep that one as backup laptop. I might sell the M1 Mac mini as well as I think that the 2 iMacs can take its place and they can support 32 GB RAM each.<br>My valuation model is Geekbench 5 score divided by price. So the Geekbench 5 score of the 2010 iMac 27 i7 is 2,245 and the price was $100 so the value ration is 22.45. My 2021 MacBook Pro 16 M1 PRO has a Geekbench 5 score of 12,115 and cost 3,099 so the value ratio is 3.91. The value ratio on my 2014 iMac is 7.54 and it is 6.73 on the M1 Mac mini. The mini will always score well because there&#39;s no display, keyboard and mouse. But in this case, the value of the 2010 iMac is the highest I&#39;ve found because it has an i7 and because the price was so low. The QHD monitor and speakers are a bonus.<br>As Dave said, people care about what the system can do, not what CPU it has or the Geekbench 5 score. The Geekbench 5 score, though, is very important if you are looking at very old hardware. The vast majority of people will not know how to value their devices. Many will just try to sell at what everyone else is selling for on Ebay or the valuations on Everymac. Those prices aren&#39;t real as you&#39;ll never sell your Mac at those prices. Some will sell them at fair market value and some will sell them well below market just so it doesn&#39;t end in a landfill. Most people won&#39;t know how to crank up the performance on these things as well. A little knowledge and the right parts and tools can extend the life of old computers for a decade.) {} Took 0.0002 seconds\n",

      "Function _polarity(<analysis.sentiment object at 0x12777aa00>, I couldn&#39;t find this video this morning and it looks like it was a bit late but it showed up in my stream this evening. I went to look at the 2010 iMac and they had it in the basement and it was on and there was a folder with a question mark on it and I thought, &quot;this isn&#39;t a good sign.&quot; So I plugged in my keyboard and mouse and rebooted it and it still had the folder with the question mark. So I tried booting it into Recovery Mode and it wouldn&#39;t go. If you&#39;re going to go look at a machine, I recommend bring a bootable flash drive or external SSD so that you can test recovery mode or look around the system. Sometimes you wind up with a system where they formatted the drive and didn&#39;t install an operating system and so you have to bring something with you if you want to find the specs.<br>So it is a Mid-2010 with i7-870, 8 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. Asking was $100 or best offer. I was hoping for an SSD and at least 8 GB of RAM in 2x4GB but it was 4x2GB. I took their offer. I could have bargained them down because they weren&#39;t going to get any other offers as very few people will buy a machine that doesn&#39;t boot. Only crazy people like me carry around an operating system with them.<br>I put it in my trunk and brought it home and had a look at it. It seemed to be fine though the fans were loud. I vacuumed around the vents but the fans were still loud. So I installed a thermal monitor and fan control problem and found that all of the temps were fine, in the 30-55 degree range. But the disk drive fan was running at 2,500 RPM even though the disk drive was at 30 degrees. So I set the fan control for the disk drive to 1,100 RPM (the lowest setting) and that fixed the fan noise. The HDDs have a thermal sensor on them and they can go bad over time and that appears to have happened here. <br>I ordered 16 GB of DDR3 1,600 (it takes 1,333 but 1,600 costs $3 less) and it will arrive in a week though more likely by Monday or Tuesday. That will give me 20 GB of RAM which is enough for office use. I will see if my wife wants the system to replace her 2018 Mac mini base model. If not, I&#39;ll put it on my desk. This means that my 2015 MacBook Pro 15 won&#39;t be needed any longer and I plan to put it up for sale. My son got his 2021 MacBook Pro 14 32/512 from his workplace so I will get my 2014 MacBook Pro 15 back from him when he finishes copying stuff off the 2014. I plan to keep that one as backup laptop. I might sell the M1 Mac mini as well as I think that the 2 iMacs can take its place and they can support 32 GB RAM each.<br>My valuation model is Geekbench 5 score divided by price. So the Geekbench 5 score of the 2010 iMac 27 i7 is 2,245 and the price was $100 so the value ration is 22.45. My 2021 MacBook Pro 16 M1 PRO has a Geekbench 5 score of 12,115 and cost 3,099 so the value ratio is 3.91. The value ratio on my 2014 iMac is 7.54 and it is 6.73 on the M1 Mac mini. The mini will always score well because there&#39;s no display, keyboard and mouse. But in this case, the value of the 2010 iMac is the highest I&#39;ve found because it has an i7 and because the price was so low. The QHD monitor and speakers are a bonus.<br>As Dave said, people care about what the system can do, not what CPU it has or the Geekbench 5 score. The Geekbench 5 score, though, is very important if you are looking at very old hardware. The vast majority of people will not know how to value their devices. Many will just try to sell at what everyone else is selling for on Ebay or the valuations on Everymac. Those prices aren&#39;t real as you&#39;ll never sell your Mac at those prices. Some will sell them at fair market value and some will sell them well below market just so it doesn&#39;t end in a landfill. Most people won&#39;t know how to crank up the performance on these things as well. A little knowledge and the right parts and tools can extend the life of old computers for a decade.) {} Took 0.0022 seconds\n",

I had a USB-C monitor, external HD, USB-C streaming stick, 2.5 GB network and USB 2.0 hub all plugged into the TB4 dock. It worked but my USB mic or streaming stick would at times disconnect or fail to reconnect when brining the computer out of sleep. My most recent change was to connect the USB-C monitor directly to the laptop via a second TB-4 port.  I then balanced my high data devices between the two ports and connect highed power draw items to powered hubs rather than the mac providing power.

Better/different cables have helped (ie TB-4 or USB 3.2) provided improved success, but didn&#39;t eliminate all issues.  Apple updates have helped some, but it also seems to be issues with power draw and possibly channel data saturation.  I have a streaming setup where everything was connected into the Air via one TB-4 cable going to the OWC TB4 dock that Dan showed.  I had a USB-C monitor, external HD, USB-C streaming stick, 2.5 GB network and USB 2.0 hub all plugged into the TB4 dock. It worked but my USB mic or streaming stick would at times disconnect or fail to reconnect when brining the computer out of sleep. My most recent change was to connect the USB-C monitor directly to the laptop via a second TB-4 port.  I then balanced my high data devices between the two ports and connect highed power draw items to powered hubs rather than the mac providing power.

      "Function _tokenise(<analysis.sentiment object at 0x12777aa00>, Mi sembra abbastanza ovvio che molte app e i giochi abbiano problemi: la scheda grafica è virtualizzata, la sua VRAM è a una bassissima frequenza e ha solo i driver generici di windows, cosa che non succede con un PC Windows dove si installano i driver Intel/Nvidia/AMD e credo che sia ovvio che avviando una macchina virtuale le performance non saranno mai il massimo. Mi sembra anche stupido però pretendere da un mac, già di per se non nato per giocare, in una VM, senza i giusti driver, in ARM64, la quale deve emulare i programmi X64, i quali devono emulare le loro librerie IA-32 (32 bit), delle azioni per cui nessuno lo userebbe. Non possiamo dire che è colpa di microsoft, neanche per l&#39;app Xbox, la quale fa i dovuti controlli sui giochi che scarica sul tuo PC e sulla macchina stessa, piuttosto è colpa del programma di virtualizzazione che non ha integrato bene la GPU virtualizzata. Neanche i mac Intel sono stati pensati per giocare e suppongo che comprando un Mac si accetti il fatto che i giochi disponibili saranno davvero pochi, specialmente con M1. Per la connessione di dispositivi, hai saltato un passaggio fondamentale: anche in Windows, con VMware, collegando un dispositivo a una porta USB lo si può collegare alla VM oppure alla macchina host; su VMware Workstation appare una finestra di dialogo, su Parallels no, quindi va cercata proprio la voce dei dispositivi esterni.

      "Function _polarity(<analysis.sentiment object at 0x12777aa00>, Mi sembra abbastanza ovvio che molte app e i giochi abbiano problemi: la scheda grafica è virtualizzata, la sua VRAM è a una bassissima frequenza e ha solo i driver generici di windows, cosa che non succede con un PC Windows dove si installano i driver Intel/Nvidia/AMD e credo che sia ovvio che avviando una macchina virtuale le performance non saranno mai il massimo. Mi sembra anche stupido però pretendere da un mac, già di per se non nato per giocare, in una VM, senza i giusti driver, in ARM64, la quale deve emulare i programmi X64, i quali devono emulare le loro librerie IA-32 (32 bit), delle azioni per cui nessuno lo userebbe. Non possiamo dire che è colpa di microsoft, neanche per l&#39;app Xbox, la quale fa i dovuti controlli sui giochi che scarica sul tuo PC e sulla macchina stessa, piuttosto è colpa del programma di virtualizzazione che non ha integrato bene la GPU virtualizzata. Neanche i mac Intel sono stati pensati per giocare e suppongo che comprando un Mac si accetti il fatto che i giochi disponibili saranno davvero pochi, specialmente con M1. Per la connessione di dispositivi, hai saltato un passaggio fondamentale: anche in Windows, con VMware, collegando un dispositivo a una porta USB lo si può collegare alla VM oppure alla macchina host; su VMware Workstation appare una finestra di dialogo, su Parallels no, quindi va cercata proprio la voce dei dispositivi esterni.
